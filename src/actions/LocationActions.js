// We create an action by creating a class, the class’ prototype methods will become the actions. The class syntax is completely optional you can use regular constructors and prototypes.

// Inside those actions you can use `this.dispatch` to dispatch your payload through the Dispatcher (Dispatcher is used to broadcast payloads to registered callbacks) and onto the stores. Finally, make sure you export the created actions using `alt.createActions`.

	fetchLocations() {
		return (dispatch) => {
			// we dispatch an event here so we can have "loading" state.
			dispatch();
			LocationSource.fetch() // fetch the mock data
